# Role-Based Routing Implementation

## Overview
The job portal now implements role-based routing that automatically directs users to the appropriate dashboard based on their user role after login.

## How It Works

### User Roles
- **Employer**: Users with `role: 'employer'` are redirected to `/employer`
- **Job Seeker/Student**: Users with any other role or no specific role are redirected to `/dashboard`

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials on `/login`
2. Backend authenticates and returns user data including `role` field
3. Frontend checks the user's role:
   - If `user.role === 'employer'` → Navigate to `/employer`
   - Otherwise → Navigate to `/dashboard`

### Routes
- `/employer` - Employer Dashboard (Protected route for employers)
- `/dashboard` - Regular user dashboard (Protected route for job seekers/students)
- Both routes are protected and require authentication

### Components Involved

#### 1. LoginPage.js
- Modified `handleSubmit` function to check user role after successful login
- Implements conditional navigation based on `user.role`

#### 2. AuthContext.js
- Added `getDefaultRedirectPath()` helper function for role-based redirects
- Can be used by other components that need to redirect users

#### 3. EmployerDashboard.js
- Already includes role validation
- Shows access denied message for non-employer users
- Checks `user?.role !== 'employer'`

#### 4. Navbar.js
- Already implements role-based navigation links
- Shows "Employer Dashboard" for employers
- Shows "Dashboard" for regular users

#### 5. App.js
- Defines both `/employer` and `/dashboard` routes
- Both are protected routes requiring authentication

## Security Notes
- Role checking is done on the frontend for UX purposes
- Backend should also validate user roles for API endpoints
- The `ProtectedRoute` component ensures only authenticated users access dashboards
- Role-specific access control is handled at the component level

## Testing the Implementation

### For Employers:
1. Register/Login with an employer account (role should be set to 'employer' in backend)
2. After successful login, should be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/employer`
3. Should see the full employer dashboard with job management tools

### For Job Seekers:
1. Register/Login with a regular user account
2. After successful login, should be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. Should see the job seeker dashboard with job listings and career tools

### Direct URL Access:
- Employers can directly access `/employer` if authenticated
- Non-employers accessing `/employer` will see an access denied message
- Job seekers can access `/dashboard` normally
- Unauthenticated users accessing either route will be redirected to `/login`

## Backend Requirements
For this to work properly, the backend login endpoint should return user data with a `role` field:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "access_token": "jwt_token_here",
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "role": "employer",  // This field is crucial
      "name": "User Name",
      // ... other user fields
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Could add more granular role-based permissions
- Implement role-based route guards at the route level
- Add admin role for super user access
- Implement role-based feature flags
